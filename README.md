- Hello, I’m Hygor! Right now I'm living at Porto, Portugal.
- I’m loving learning web development everyday. 
- I'm currently taking the The Odin Project course and some other neat resources always by my side. I'll be uploading my course and personal projects no matter how beginner they are. 
- I have no problems communicating in English and I have experience with Linux, using Arch to study and code.
