- Hello, I’m Hygor!
- I’m interested in automation, machine learning and front-end development.
- I'm currently taking the The Odin Project and Freecodecamp courses. I'll be uploading my projects and documenting my progress on my blog.
- I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects since that's what I'm learning right now.
