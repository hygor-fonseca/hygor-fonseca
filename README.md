- Hello, I’m Hygor! Right now I'm living at Porto, Portugal.
- It’s being an amazing experience to learn web development everyday, I wasn’t really expecting it. I’m excited when I fisish a project or learn a new technology.   
- I'm currently taking the The Odin Project course and I have other neat resources always by my side. I'll be uploading my course and personal projects no matter how beginner they are now, everything will be documentated.  
- I have no problems communicating in English and I have experience with Linux, using Arch to study and code.
