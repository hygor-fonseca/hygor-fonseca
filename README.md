- Hello, I’m Hygor! Right now I'm living at Porto, Portugal.
- I’m interested in fullstack web development. Later in my path I plan to get into automation and too. 
- I'm currently taking the The Odin Project course, with Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp and other resources also by my side. I'll be uploading my projects and documenting my progress on my blog.
- I’m looking forward to collaborate on front-end projects since that's what I'm learning right now.
- My biggest desire is to learn and work with Python. But it will be a reward after I study to get a job as a web developer working with Javascript. 
- I have no problems communicating in English and I have experience with Linux, it`s my daily driver OS.
